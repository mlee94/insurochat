# insurochat
A langchain model designed to query financial and insurance policies and do away with the call centre interaction.

To run the group experiment from the Peregian AI hackathon, please start by installing `python==3.10.9`.

Then navigate to the directory containing `requirements.txt` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install the required dependencies - note `faiss-cpu` might need to be changed to `faiss` instead. 

I'm running this on a Ubuntu Linux.
